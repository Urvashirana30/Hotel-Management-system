# Hotel-Management-system
Project Overview:
This Hotel Management System (HMS) will allow users (hotel staff and guests) to interact with a user-friendly interface for performing different operations related to hotel management.

Key Features:

User Management:
Admin can add, update, and delete user accounts (for staff).
Different roles can be assigned to users (admin, receptionist, manager).
Each user will have different levels of access to the system.

Guest Booking System:
Guests can check room availability in real-time.
Admin or receptionists can book rooms for guests (single, double, suite, etc.).
The system allows guests to enter personal information (name, address, contact, etc.) while making a reservation.
Different payment options (cash, card, etc.) can be integrated.

Room Management:
Admin can manage room status (available, booked, under maintenance).
Admin can add, update, or delete room details (price, type, amenities, etc.).
The system will notify the user when a room is available or unavailable.

Billing System:
After checkout, the system calculates the guestâ€™s final bill based on their stay duration and additional services.
Admin can apply discounts, taxes, and service charges.
Payment receipt generation for guests.

Housekeeping Management:
Staff can update the status of rooms (cleaned, requires cleaning).
Admin can assign tasks to the housekeeping team and track progress.

Reports and Analytics:
Admin can view daily, weekly, or monthly reports on bookings, revenue, room occupancy, etc.
Detailed customer information can be accessed for follow-ups or marketing purposes.

Technologies Used:

Frontend:
HTML5/CSS3: For creating the structure and styling of the user interface (UI).
JavaScript: For dynamic content, form validations, and interaction with the backend.
jQuery: (optional) For easy DOM manipulation and AJAX functionality to update parts of the page without reloading.
Bootstrap (optional): For responsive design, ensuring the system works well on both desktops and mobile devices.

Backend:
PHP: For server-side scripting, handling business logic, processing user inputs, and interacting with the database.
AJAX (with JavaScript): To perform background tasks such as checking room availability or processing a booking request without refreshing the page.
Database:
MySQL or MariaDB: For storing and managing hotel data such as room availability, guest details, bookings, payments, and staff management.

The database will consist of several tables, including:
users: Stores user credentials and roles.
rooms: Stores information about rooms (ID, type, price, status, etc.).
guests: Stores guest information (name, contact, booking history, etc.).
bookings: Stores booking information (room ID, guest ID, check-in/out dates, payment status, etc.).
payments: Stores transaction details for each booking.
SQL Queries: SQL queries will be used to interact with the database, such as:
Inserting new bookings (INSERT INTO).
Retrieving available rooms (SELECT).
Updating room availability or booking status (UPDATE).
Deleting old records or canceled bookings (DELETE).
Generating reports with aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, SUM, etc.).

System Workflow:

Homepage (Frontend):
Users can view available rooms, promotions, and hotel information.
The booking interface allows guests to select room type, dates, and view real-time availability.
Admins can log in to access the dashboard.
Login/Authentication (Backend):
Admin and staff log in with their credentials.
After successful authentication, they are redirected to their specific dashboard (admin, receptionist, etc.).
Password hashing and session management are used to secure login.

Booking Process:
The guest chooses dates and room type (single, double, etc.).
The system checks room availability using SQL queries.
Guest provides personal information and selects a payment method.
A booking confirmation is sent via email, and the room status is updated in the database.

Checkout Process:
After the stay, guests can check out, and the final bill is calculated based on their booking duration and additional services used.
Payment is processed, and a receipt is generated.
The system updates the room status to "available."

Admin Dashboard:
Admin can view and manage all reservations, staff, and rooms.
Admin has access to detailed reports (bookings, revenue, customer feedback).
